## Mini-Airline

As an inspiration from Dinosaur Polo Clubâ€™s game development, I designed a Unity strategy-simulation game called Mini Airline. 
It is written in C# and intended to construct an airline map. The users will draw a line between airports in order to connect them.
As new airports show up, re-graph your lines to keep them functional. The users will decide an efficient way to 
distribute limited resources and keep the airline running as long as possible.
